Installation
------------

### Complete Installation [recommended]

To install pyLoad and all its optional dependencies,
type in a terminal/command prompt window (as root/administrator):

    pip install --pre pyload-dev[all]

### Minimum Installation

To install pyLoad (and its essential dependencies),
type in a terminal/command prompt window (as root/administrator):

    pip install --pre pyload-dev

### Troubleshooting

If the installation fails due to an error related to the `pycurl` package,
you may have to install it apart, before installing pyLoad.

Currently, PycURL does not support Python releases later than version 3.6,
but un-official Windows binary packages for latest Python versions are available
on https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pycurl .

**As an example**,
to install *PycURL 7.43.1* for Python 3.7 on Windows 64-bit, you have to
download the file named `pycurl-7.43.1-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl`
and type in a terminal/command prompt window (as root/administrator):

    pip install pycurl-7.43.1-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl

When the installation succesfully finishes you can safely delete the downloaded file.

Visit http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/install.html to learn how to get and install
the appropriate PycURL package for your system.
